it's not the waking, it's the rising. it is the grounding of a foot uncompromising. it's not forgoing of the lie, it's not the opening of eyes, it's not the waking, it's the rising.  it's not the shade, we should be past it. it's the light and it's the obstacle that casts it. it's the heat that drives the light, it's the fire it ignites, it's not the waking, it's the rising.  it's not the song, it’s the singing, it's the heaven of the human spirit ringing. it is the bringing of the line, it is the baring of the rhyme, it's not the waking, it's the rising.  and i could cry power, power, power. nina cried power, billie cried power, mavis cried power.  and i could cry power, power, power, power. curtis cried power, patti cried power, nina cried power. [break][break]

it's not the wall but what's behind it. oh, the fear of fellow man, his mere assignment. and everything that we're denied by keeping the divide, it's not the waking, it's the rising.  and i could cry power, power, oh, power. nina cried power, lennon cried power, james brown cried power. and i could cry power, power, power, power, lord, b.b. cried power, joni cried power, nina cried power.  and i could cry power! power has been cried by those stronger than me, straight into the face that tells you to "rattle your chains if you love being free."  i could cry power, and power is my love when my love reaches to me. james brown cried power, seeger cried power, marvin cried power. james cried power, lennon cried power, patti cried power. billie, power, dylan, power, woody, power, nina cried power.
